# 01 - Introduction to Networking (Networking Fundamentals)

Welcome to **Module 1: Networking Fundamentals**! 🌐  
This module will give you a strong foundation in computer networking — the backbone of DevOps and cloud computing.  



## 📌 What is Computer Networking?

- **Computer Networking** is the practice of connecting two or more computers so they can share **data and resources**.  
- Enables communication between **servers, clients, and devices**.  



## 🏷 Types of Networks

1. **LAN (Local Area Network)** - Small area like home, office  
2. **WAN (Wide Area Network)** - Covers large areas, e.g., internet  
3. **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)** - City-wide network  
4. **WLAN (Wireless LAN)** - Wireless connections in LAN  



## 🔧 Components of Networking

- **Router** - Directs network traffic between networks  
- **Switch** - Connects devices in a LAN  
- **Hub** - Simple device to connect multiple computers  
- **NIC (Network Interface Card)** - Hardware that connects a device to a network  
- **Firewall** - Protects network from unauthorized access  



## 📡 Protocols

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** - Reliable data delivery  
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** - Fast but less reliable  
- **HTTP / HTTPS** - Web communication  
- **FTP / SFTP** - File transfers  
- **DNS** - Domain name resolution  



## 📏 Standards

- **IEEE** - Defines networking hardware standards (e.g., Ethernet)  
- **IETF** - Standardizes protocols like TCP/IP  
- **ISO** - OSI model and general network standards  



## ⚡ Summary

- Networking connects devices and enables communication  
- Networks can be **LAN, WAN, MAN, or WLAN**  
- Key components: **Router, Switch, NIC, Firewall**  
- Important protocols: **TCP, UDP, HTTP, FTP, DNS**  
- Standards help devices and protocols work **together consistently**  



💡 **Pro Tip:** Try to visualize a small network at home: connect your PC, router, and phone. Understand which device is the **switch, router, or NIC**. This will make concepts easier to remember.
